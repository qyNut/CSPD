# Training
- The network was trained on a self-collected dataset acquired from brains of 17 mice. The pretrained model was provided in models/pretrained. An example of training data sample was provided in data/train. 

# Testing
- Pretrained models can be used for testing. An example of testing data sample was provided in data/test.
